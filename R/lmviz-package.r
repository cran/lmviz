#'   \item{\code{\link{BadLM}}}{allows to set a data generating mechanism violating the homoscedasticity and/or normality assumptions of the linear model and explore by simulation its consequences on inference}
#'   \item{\code{\link{QuizResidual}}}{a game in which the user is prompted to guess whether the diagnostic plots of a linear model suggest some hypotheses is violated}
